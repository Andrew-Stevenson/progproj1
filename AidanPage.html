	<h1>Computer Science & Music in Society</h1>
	<h5><em>This page will explain how computer science has helped music become a vital part of society</em></h5>
	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>Digital music is simply a form of digital audio, and Digital audio is audio, or simply sound, signal that has been recorded as or converted into digital form, where the sound wave of the audio signal is encoded as numerical samples in continuous sequence, typically at CD audio quality which is 16 bit sample depth over 44.1 thousand samples per second. Digital audio is the name for the entire technology of sound recording and reproduction using audio signals that have been encoded in digital form. Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the 1970s, it gradually replaced analog audio technology in many areas of audio engineering and telecommunications in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

	<h3>Uses</h3>
	<p>Digital music can contribute to society in some of the following ways:</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  		<li>Vastly simplified ways of music sharing with friends</li>
		<li>Ease of (very often free) music streaming to discover new music</li>
 		<li>Can be used by DJs for events, bars, and clubs</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Case study: beginner DJ</h3>
	<p>As a beginner DJ I find the modern form of digital music extremely helpful. It means that I can easily find songs and tracks which match my sets on music streaming sites (mainly youtube and soundcloud), and it allows me and other DJs to share our works online. This gives a massive range of choice of tracks for me to use, for example it means for every song released, I could find a wealth of remixes, bootlegs, mashups, and remakes of that song to find my ideal version. This is beneficial to the audience as well as I often find very good bootlegs and remixes on youtube which may have only been viewed a few thousand times, and it can amaze the crowd when they heard something of such high quality which they will have almost definitely never heard before!</p>
