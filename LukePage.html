			<p>In a world with an ageing population, clever solutions are required to provide effective care to a large number of elderly people in care-homes. 
			Computer science can aid in meeting this need, and an example of this is the development of smart robotic pets for the elderly residents to spend time with. 
			Pets are known to help reduce stress, increase social interaction and lower blood pressure, as well as reduce symptoms of depression and lonliness. 
			Unfortunately, real animals require food, water and exercise, and in a care-home environment these needs would primarily have to be met by staff to ensure the animals' welfare. 
			This isn't possible in most care-homes as the priority of the nursing staff is caring for the human residents and staff are unlikely to have the time to care for animals as well. 
			Therefore, being able to provide the positive effects of pet ownership without real animals through the use of robotic creatures can have a great impact on quality of care, as the positive effects 
			described could not otherwise be provided. This is a prime example of computer science having a positive impact on society - in this example not only are the direct users of the systems benefitting, 
			but also the staff who have their workload reduced and the residents' families who benefit from the knowledge of their relatives' better care.</p>
